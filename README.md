Hi, I'm Michael Zhao. I'm a recent graduate of [Georgetown University]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgetown_University"), I enjoy reading, writing, programming, and investing in public equities. I work at [Federal Capital Partners]("https://www.fcpdc.com/"), a real estate private equity firm, where I help run our multifamily investments in the Southeast US + scale our real estate asset management technology platform. Interested in learning and building as much as I can.
