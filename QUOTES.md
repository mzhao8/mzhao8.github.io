### Quotes

* “Above all, don't lie to yourself.

And having no respect he ceases to love.” ― Fyodor Dostoevsky, The Brothers Karamazov

* “Think of the sound you make when you let go after holding your breath for a very, very long time. Think of the gladdest sound you know: the sound of dawn on the first day of spring break, the sound of a bottle of Coke opening, the sound of a crowd cheering in your ears because you're coming down to the last part of a race--and you're ahead. Think of the sound of water over stones in a cold stream, and the sound of wind through green trees on a late May afternoon in Central Park. Think of the sound of a bus coming into the station carrying someone you love. Then put all those together.” ― Gary D. Schmidt, The Wednesday Wars

* “A comedy isn’t about being funny...a comedy is about characters who dare to know that they may choose a happy ending after all.” ― Gary D. Schmidt, The Wednesday Wars

* “Weakness and ignorance are not barriers to survival, but arrogance is.” ― Liu Cixin, Death's End

* “It’s a wonder to be alive. If you don’t understand that, how can you search for anything deeper?” ― Liu Cixin, The Dark Forest
