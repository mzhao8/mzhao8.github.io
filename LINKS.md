1.  Internal Memos

    I love reading internal memos - it helps me understand how insiders think about strategy and how they
    communicate their plans. Compared to public press releases, internal memos are less abstracted and filtered. Credits to Sriram K for compiling these:

    * [Zuckerberg on the Messenger Ecosystem](https://sriramk.com/memos/zuck-messenger-ecosystem.pdf)
    * sub-bullet two

2.  Continuing the list

    1. sub-list numbered one
    2. sub-list numbered two

3.  Another list item.
