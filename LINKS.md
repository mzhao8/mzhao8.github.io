1.  Internal Memos

    I love reading internal memos - it helps me understand how insiders think about strategy and how they communicate their plans. Compared to public press releases, internal memos are less abstracted and filtered. Special thanks to [Sriram K](https://sriramk.com/) for finding and compiling the Facebook, Disney, and Sequoia memos:

    * [Zuckerberg on the Messenger Ecosystem](https://sriramk.com/memos/zuck-messenger-ecosystem.pdf)
    * [Zuckerberg negogiating with Kevin Systrom over the Instagram acquisition](https://sriramk.com/memos/zuck_systrom.pdf)
    * [Zuckerberg on why Facebook should buy Unity](https://sriramk.com/memos/zuck-unity.pdf)
    * [Jeffrey Katzenberg on how to revitalize Disney Studios](https://sriramk.com/memos/katzenberg.pdf)
    * [Roelof Botha's internal investment thesis to Sequoia for YouTube](https://sriramk.com/memos/roelof-youtube.pdf)
    * [Sam Zell's The Grave Dancer, a primer on how to approach distressed real estate](https://www.samzell.com/wp-content/uploads/1982_The_Grave_Dancer.pdf)
    * [Trammell Crow memos after the savings and loans crisis](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/583dd4ce725e25dc1167e2f8/t/5ec46ed40dec8d7e10e5edf8/1589931736874/Trammel+Crow+Lessons+learned_from_the_real_estate_crisis_of_the_1980_s_1585704769+%281%29.pdf)
    

2.  Essays
    
    Essays that I often reread that have significantly shaped my thinking
    * [Blas Moros' The Inifinte Game](https://secureservercdn.net/166.62.107.55/297.bb9.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/The-Infinite-Game_Rabbit-Hole-1.pdf) - taught me about how self-awareness and close examination of yourself is a requirement to taking control of your own life. Create a priority framework and iterate from there.
