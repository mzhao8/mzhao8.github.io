1.  Internal Memos

    I love reading internal memos - it helps me understand how insiders think about strategy and how they communicate their plans. Compared to public press releases, internal memos are less abstracted and filtered. Special thanks to [Sriram K](https://sriramk.com/) for finding and compiling the Facebook, Disney, and Sequoia memos:

    * [Zuckerberg on the Messenger Ecosystem](https://sriramk.com/memos/zuck-messenger-ecosystem.pdf)
    * [Zuckerberg negogiating with Kevin Systrom over the Instagram acquisition](https://sriramk.com/memos/zuck_systrom.pdf)
    * [Zuckerberg on why Facebook should buy Unity](https://sriramk.com/memos/zuck-unity.pdf)
    * [Jeffrey Katzenberg on how to revitalize Disney Studios](https://sriramk.com/memos/katzenberg.pdf)
    * [Roelof Botha's internal investment thesis to Sequoia for YouTube](https://sriramk.com/memos/roelof-youtube.pdf)
