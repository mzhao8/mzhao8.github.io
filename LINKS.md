* ### Internal Memos

    I love reading internal memos - it helps me understand how insiders think about strategy and how they communicate their plans. Compared to public press releases, internal memos are less abstracted and filtered. Special thanks to [Sriram K](https://sriramk.com/) for finding and compiling the Facebook, Disney, and Sequoia memos:

    * [Zuckerberg on the Messenger Ecosystem](https://sriramk.com/memos/zuck-messenger-ecosystem.pdf) Zuck wrote these a while ago, and it's cool to see the changes he discussed in these emails implemented into the messenger product 4 years later, with varying degrees of success. 
    * [Zuckerberg negogiating with Kevin Systrom over the Instagram acquisition](https://sriramk.com/memos/zuck_systrom.pdf) The gist of this article revolved around how Instagram would look if Facebook were to acquire it. Would it be swallowed under the Facebook umbrella or would it operate on a standalone basis? Looking back, it seems like Instagram has thrived as a mostly standalone product combined with Facebook's ad tech to generate revenue. 
    * [Zuckerberg on why Facebook should buy Unity](https://sriramk.com/memos/zuck-unity.pdf) This memo from years ago spurred my decision to purchase shares in $U when they IPO'd. Zuckerberg's vision of future social interaction revolves around VR/AR. The recent popularity of games like Fortnite and Roblox confirmed that. $U is primary game dev tool used in mobile and AR, and I believe it's usage will grow as gaming becomes a larger and more accepted part of entertainment.
    * [Jeffrey Katzenberg on how to revitalize Disney Studios](https://sriramk.com/memos/katzenberg.pdf) TLDR: Focus on timeless stories, don't scoff at the competition.
    * [Roelof Botha's internal investment thesis to Sequoia for YouTube](https://sriramk.com/memos/roelof-youtube.pdf) YouTube seems to be endpoint for influencers in the creator economy. Typically the process goes something like this: Go viral on TikTok or Instagram -> create a YouTube channel and develop deeper connections with more personal videos. Right now, it's the most long-form and entertaining visual medium for creators to interact with their fans. It makes a ton of revenue for Google too. It's interesting to see how Botha saw the space back during the early innings, especially in regards to competitors and revenue generation strategies.
    * [Sam Zell's The Grave Dancer, a primer on how to approach distressed real estate](https://www.samzell.com/wp-content/uploads/1982_The_Grave_Dancer.pdf) Great read on how to approach investing in distressed real estate from a legend.
    * [Trammell Crow memos after the savings and loans crisis](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/583dd4ce725e25dc1167e2f8/t/5ec46ed40dec8d7e10e5edf8/1589931736874/Trammel+Crow+Lessons+learned_from_the_real_estate_crisis_of_the_1980_s_1585704769+%281%29.pdf) The TLDR on the S&L crisis was that S&L's had low profits because they borrowed at really high interest rates (set by the fed), but were stuck on making money on low interest mortgage loans. Reagan signs an act, which eliminated LTV ratios and interest rate caps for S&Ls. This led to speculative lending and fraud, and eventually when everything unwound, turned into more than 700 S&L failures. Many of these happened in Texas, and that's where Trammell Crow was exposed the most. These were some of the lessons they learned. Contains gems like "Product should dictate land price. Land price should not dictate product", "Confusing quality with image; and focusing on high-end projects when the market demand had shifted to middle-income or price-sensitive centers e.g. with discount anchors", "Office buildings have a long product lifecycle ... A lot can change in this time period. This dramatically exacerbates the unpredictability of two of the most volatile components of profitability: The loss to lease up costs and yields"
    

* ### Essays
    
    Essays that I often reread that I found interesting or have shaped my thinking

    * [Blas Moros' The Infinte Game](https://secureservercdn.net/166.62.107.55/297.bb9.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/The-Infinite-Game_Rabbit-Hole-1.pdf) - Taught me about how self-awareness and close examination of yourself is a requirement to taking control of your own life. Create a priority framework and iterate from there.
    * [Blas Moros' Learning Process](https://secureservercdn.net/166.62.107.55/297.bb9.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/My-Learning-Process-1.pdf) - How one of the most well-read people I know creates systems to accomplish things. Chunking time, eliminating deadtime, aiming to build rather than consume, using Evernote and Wunderlist to organize projects, prioritizing health and family, etc. I think he's able to read 5 books a month despite the fact that he has a family, a full-time job, and in the process of starting a start-up.
    * [Patrick Collison - Advice](https://patrickcollison.com/advice) - General advice from the co-founder of Stripe, one of the most valuable private companies right now that is democratiazing transactions in the form of frictionless APIs. "In particular, try to go deep on multiple things. (To varying degrees, I tried to go deep on languages, programming, writing, physics, math. Some of those stuck more than others.) One of the main things you should try to achieve by age 20 is some sense for which kinds of things you enjoy doing. This probably won't change a lot throughout your life and so you should try to discover the shape of that space as quickly as you can."
    * [Marc Andreessen's Guide to Personal Productivity](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_personal_productivity.html) Gave me a system to organize my emails.
    * [Paul Graham - Life is Short](http://www.paulgraham.com/vb.html) "Ok, so life actually is short. Does it make any difference to know that? It has for me. It means arguments of the form "Life is too short for x" have great force. It's not just a figure of speech to say that life is too short for something. It's not just a synonym for annoying. If you find yourself thinking that life is too short for something, you should try to eliminate it if you can. When I ask myself what I've found life is too short for, the word that pops into my head is "bullshit." I realize that answer is somewhat tautological. It's almost the definition of bullshit that it's the stuff that life is too short for."
    * [Paul Graham - Cities and Ambition](http://www.paulgraham.com/cities.html) "Great cities attract ambitious people. You can sense it when you walk around one. In a hundred subtle ways, the city sends you a message: you could do more; you should try harder. The surprising thing is how different these messages can be. New York tells you, above all: you should make more money. There are other messages too, of course. You should be hipper. You should be better looking. But the clearest message is that you should be richer." Environment influences thinking and priorities.
    * [Paul Graham - Schlep Blindness](http://www.paulgraham.com/schlep.html) Sometimes ignorance about how hard a problem is removes the bottleneck for trying.
    * [Paul Graham - How To Do What You Love](http://www.paulgraham.com/love.html) "Another test you can use is: always produce. For example, if you have a day job you don’t take seriously because you plan to be a novelist, are you producing? Are you writing pages of fiction, however bad? As long as you’re producing, you’ll know you’re not merely using the hazy vision of the grand novel you plan to write one day as an opiate. The view of it will be obstructed by the all too palpably flawed one you’re actually writing. “Always produce” is also a heuristic for finding the work you love. If you subject yourself to that constraint, it will automatically push you away from things you think you’re supposed to work on, toward things you actually like. “Always produce” will discover your life’s work the way water, with the aid of gravity, finds the hole in your roof."
    * [Collaborative Fund - The Three Sides of Risk](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-three-sides-of-risk/) Beautiful and tragic story. Ultimately tail risks are the only risks that matter.
    * [Simon Sarris - Stoicism is Not Enough](https://medium.com/@simon.sarris/stoicism-is-not-enough-34181d34264c) Ironically I loved "This is Water" by David Foster Wallace, but Sarris brings up valid points against Stoicism. Never thought about the context of when Meditations was written - but with a crumbling empire infected by plague, the Stoic mindset was probably the best mindset to have in that situation. I think Sarris views certain things as objective (maybe objectively good or objectively bad), whereas through Stoicism, people can bend the rules based on inner willpower. Objectivity loses meaning and certain emotions are shut off. These emotions are important for us to feel wonder and induce feelings of sacredness. Rather than pure Stoicism, which only allows life to be "survivable", aim to live a good life. Instead of fully turning inward, realize that the ultimate goals transcend the individuals and are ultimately passed on to others. External events are important if we want to cultivate change.
    * [Sam Altman - Researchers and Founders](https://blog.samaltman.com/researchers-and-founders) What are the successful traits of researchers and founders? Self-belief, willing to work hard, bias towards action, honest about what isn't working, creative idea-generators, value autonomy, frequently driven by genuine curiousity.
    * [Ava Huang - On continually renegotiating your identity](https://reading.supply/post/9cce6883-446b-482c-8f76-bbee9380fdde) "It's impossible to completely escape the pull of instinct and self-optimization, but my experience has been that I am happiest when I take my identity less seriously and give myself permission to continually renegotiate it...If we reject the illusion of a fixed identity and keep ourselves open (always staying partially in crisis) we make discovering whom we are and what we're able to do a lifelong project. I love Rachel Cusk paraphrasing D.H. Lawrence: 'Some people have a lot farther to go from where they begin to get where they want to be—a long way up the mountain, and that is how it has been for me. I don’t feel I am getting older; I feel I am getting closer.'"
    * [Ava Huang - On maintaining attention](https://ava.substack.com/p/on-maintaining-attention) "Life is a fight against entropy, I think as I gather up Waterloo sparkling water cans, half-empty mugs of coffee and three pairs of sweatpants strewn over the sofa, grudgingly restoring the apartment to order. Thanks to lockdown I've very belatedly entered some approximation of adult domesticity, and mostly I find it... hilarious. Like: you have to keep cleaning the apartment on an infinite weekly cycle in order to stop it from collapsing into disarray. You have to keep buying groceries, and keep looking up recipes, and keeping baking cookies at the same rate you consume them."
    * [Ava Huang - On not losing my nerve](https://ava.substack.com/p/on-not-losing-my-nerve) "When talking to a friend the other day about creative work I realized that a constant resolution that helps me continue is the thought that I can’t lose my nerve. It’s like walking on a tightrope: there are infinite ways to fuck up and fall, but it’s important to not think about it too much, or else you’ll psych yourself out and actually fall when you otherwise might’ve been okay."
    * [John Gardner - The Road to Self-Renewal](https://medium.com/jvnto/the-road-to-self-renewal-bda7aa530dbe) Speech delievered by John Gardner in 1990 to McKinsey & Company. He talks about the velocity of careers, why some die, and how some renew themselves. How do you maintain velocity, avoid complacency, and get better? "“Meaning is not something you stumble across, like the answer to a riddle or the prize in a treasure hunt. Meaning is something you build into your life. You build it out of your own past, out of your affections and loyalties, out of the experience of humankind as it is passed on to you, out of your own talent and understanding, out of the things you believe in, out of the things and people you love, out of the values for which you are willing to sacrifice something. The ingredients are there. You are the only one who can put them together into that unique pattern that will be your life. Let it be a life that has dignity and meaning for you. If it does, then the particular balance of success or failure is of less account.”
    * [Andy Dunn - The Risk Not Taken](https://medium.com/@dunn/the-risk-not-taken-40cf0a8919cb) Beautiful essay by the founder of Bonobos, his journey across the world, and why he decided to not take a lucrative job after graduation. "The risk not taken is more dangerous than the risk taken. I realized that I had defined risk the wrong way twice. The first time was thinking it was risky to travel abroad in the developing world, and yet what a risk it would have been not to have done so. The second time I had been thinking risk was not taking a steady job. No — I realized — risk is not having access to food, healthcare, and education. Risk is what is facing Stanley’s children, it is not what is facing me. It turns out there is risk in taking the steady job. The risk is generally not financial. It is spiritual."
    * [Wait But Why - How to Pick Your Life Partner, Pt. 1](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/02/pick-life-partner.html)
    * [Wait But Why - How to Pick Your Life Partner, Pt. 2](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/02/pick-life-partner-part-2.html)
    * [Wait But Why - How to Beat Procrastination](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/how-to-beat-procrastination.html) "No one “builds a house.” They lay one brick again and again and again and the end result is a house. Procrastinators are great visionaries—they love to fantasize about the beautiful mansion they will one day have built—but what they need to be are gritty construction workers, who methodically lay one brick after the other, day after day, without giving up, until a house is built." 
    * [Wait But Why - The Procrastination Matrix](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/03/procrastination-matrix.html) "The distinction between an ordinary person and an extraordinary person might simply come down to the differences in how they allot their time points."
    * [Wait But Why - The Tail End](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html) A visual representation of the time you have left. I think it was this essay that made me think more about the importance of visualzations - a good visualization can carry life-altering messages if done in the correct way. This is what happened here. Takeaways:
    1) Living in the same place as the people you love matters.** I probably have 10X the time left with the people who live in my city as I do with the people who live somewhere else.
    2) Priorities matter. Your remaining face time with any person depends largely on where that person falls on your list of life priorities. Make sure this list is set by you—not by unconscious inertia.
    3) Quality time matters. If you’re in your last 10% of time with someone you love, keep that fact in the front of your mind when you’re with them and treat that time as what it actually is: precious.
    * [John Salvatier - Reality has a surprising amount of detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail) "Before you’ve noticed important details they are, of course, basically invisible. It’s hard to put your attention on them because you don’t even know what you’re looking for. But after you see them they quickly become so integrated into your intuitive models of the world that they become essentially transparent. Do you remember the insights that were crucial in learning to ride a bike or drive? How about the details and insights you have that led you to be good at the things you’re good at?... The direction for improvement is clear: seek detail you would not normally notice about the world. When you go for a walk, notice the unexpected detail in a flower or what the seams in the road imply about how the road was built... If you wish to not get stuck, seek to perceive what you have not yet perceived."
    * [Patrick McKenzie - Doing Business In Japan](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2014/11/07/doing-business-in-japan/) As someone who thinks about going to Japan at least once a day, this article provided a fascinating perspective on corporate culture in Japan. Pretty long, but couldn't put it down.
    * [Patrick McKenzie - Running A Software Business On 5 Hours a Week](https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/03/20/running-a-software-business-on-5-hours-a-week/) Practical advice on how to start and run a software business with not that much time. 
    * [Nate Soares - Conviction without self-deception](http://mindingourway.com/conviction-without-s/) "I think it's important to tease apart feelings from beliefs. If you're standing on that diving platform, I think it's important to simultaneously know you have a 17% chance of victory, and fill yourself with the excitement, focus, and confidence of the second swimmer. Become able to tap into conviction, without any need for the self-deception."
    * [Nate Soares - Dive In](http://mindingourway.com/dive-in-2/)In my experience, the way you end up doing good in the world has very little to do with how good your initial plan was. Most of your outcome will depend on luck, timing, and your ability to actually get out of your own way and start somewhere. The way to end up with a good plan is not to start with a good plan, it's to start with some plan, and then slam that plan against reality until reality hands you a better plan.
    * [Autotranslucence - Becoming a Magician](https://autotranslucence.wordpress.com/2018/03/30/becoming-a-magician/) "So, in short, a helpful strategy for becoming a magician: Surround yourself with people who look like magicians to you. Then imagine yourself as one, older and wiser, in great detail. Imagine yourself as the person you would be afraid to say you want to be out loud to others (because it seems so ridiculously impossible right now)."
    * [Eugene Wei - Chinese Robber Fallacy](https://www.eugenewei.com/blog/2015/9/20/chinese-robber-fallacy) Great introduction into base rates using a simple example. "There are over a billion Chinese people. If even one in a thousand is a robber, you can provide one million examples of Chinese robbers to appease the doubters. Most people think of stereotyping as “Here’s one example I heard of where the out-group does something bad,” and then you correct it with “But we can’t generalize about an entire group just from one example!” It’s less obvious that you may be able to provide literally one million examples of your false stereotype and still have it be a false stereotype. If you spend twelve hours a day on the task and can describe one crime every ten seconds, you can spend four months doing nothing but providing examples of burglarous Chinese – and still have absolutely no point."
    * [Richard Hamming - You and Your Research](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html) "It was pretty clear to me that this man didn't know much mathematics and he wasn't really articulate. His problem seemed interesting so I took it home and did a little work. I finally showed him how to run computers so he could compute his own answers. I gave him the power to compute. He went ahead, with negligible recognition from his own department, but ultimately he has collected all the prizes in the field. Once he got well started, his shyness, his awkwardness, his inarticulateness, fell away and he became much more productive in many other ways. Certainly he became much more articulate."
    * [Kevin Simler](https://meltingasphalt.com/ads-dont-work-that-way/) "Cultural imprinting is the mechanism whereby an ad, rather than trying to change our minds individually, instead changes the landscape of cultural meanings — which in turn changes how we are perceived by others when we use a product. Whether you drink Corona or Heineken or Budweiser "says" something about you. But you aren't in control of that message; it just sits there, out in the world, having been imprinted on the broader culture by an ad campaign. It's then up to you to decide whether you want to align yourself with it...In this way, cultural imprinting relies on the principle of common knowledge. For a fact to be common knowledge among a group, it's not enough for everyone to know it. Everyone must also know that everyone else knows it."

* ### Videos
    * [Peter Thiel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFZrL1RiuVI&ab_channel=ChicagoIdeas) Competition is for losers because competition kills profits. You want to aim to create a differentiated company = monopoly. Doesn't apply to companies, but also careers. Great primer on his book Zero to One.

That's maybe the most important thing you can realize in your life, is that every aspect of your life is a choice. But there are default choices. You can choose to sleepwalk through your life and accept the path that's been laid out for you. You can choose to accept the world as it is. But you don't have to. If there is something in the world you feel is a wrong and you have a vision for what a better world could be, you can find your guiding principle. And you can fight for a cause. So after this talk, I'd like you to take a little time and think about what matters to you. What you believe in. And what you might fight for."
